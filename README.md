Project Title:
Chat with MySQL Database using Google AI


Project Objectives: 
Build LLM project Using Langchain, Gemini model based on Data stored in MySQL Database. 
We will use SQL Database chain in Langchain along with a few shot learning to fine tune the model for accurate prediction and build a question-and-answer system that can talk to MySQL database and generate answers.


Deliverables: 
User Interface developed via Streamlit with Input Box to type in the user Questions and Answers will be displayed upon hitting ‘Enter’ along with chat history. 

Design:

The chatbot works by taking a user's natural language query, converting it into a SQL query using Gemini-Pro LLM model, executing the query on a SQL database, and then presenting the results back to the user in natural language. This process involves several steps of data processing and interaction with the Google API and a SQL database, all seamlessly integrated into a Streamlit application.
